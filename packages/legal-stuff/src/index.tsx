          Lendi is a privately owned and operated Aussie business. Our mission is to provide Aussies with the right
          experience when choosing a home loan from our panel of lenders. Although Lendi compares over 1600 products
          from over 35 lenders, we don't cover the whole market or compare all features and there may be other features
          or options available to you. While Lendi is 40% owned by founders and employees, we have also been supported
          by some great minority shareholders including Bailador, Macquarie Bank Ltd and a number of Australian
          sophisticated investors. We have an independent and founder led board.
