## breakpoints

| Name    | Value   |
| ------- |:-------:|
| xs      | 0       |
| sm      | 576px   |
| md      | 768px   |
| lg      | 992px   |
| xl      | 1200px  |

## LUI and BreakpointValueMatch

Many LUI components have props that are responsive compatible. They accept an object of type BreakpointValueMatch. This allows you to, instead of providing a single value for the prop, provide a value per breakpoint.

For example our grid unit can be written:

```tsx
<Grid.Unit size={{xs: 1, md: 1 / 2, xl: 1 / 4}}>{children}</Grid.Unit>
```

This will apply the desired values using our `gte` (greater than or equal to) media query function.

## legacy breakpoints

For versions ^5.0.0 we will continue to support our legacy breakpoints. However it is recommended to modify your code to use the new breakpoints as soon as possible as they will not be supported in the future.

| Name          | Value          |
| ------------- |:--------------:|
| mobile (xs)   | 0              |
| tablet (sm)   | 576px          |
| desktop (xl)  | 1200px         |

## Breakpoints in Typescript/Javascript

Get the name of the current breakpoint by calling `getBreakpoint()` in your Typescript.

If you need to update the breakpoint as the window changes you can use the helper React hook `useBreakpoint(callback: (breakpoint: BreakpointName) => any, debounceInterval: number)`.

## Testing

When testing with `getBreakpoint` or `useBreakpoint` it is advised to mock `@lendi-ui/breakpoint` as `window.matchMedia` is not available on the JSDOM. If you need to test resize functionality, you can instead add something like the following code to your tests to mock the `window.matchMedia` function:

```ts
import { match } from 'css-mediaquery';

const width: number = 1201

window.matchMedia = jest.fn().mockImplementation((query: string) => ({
  matches: match(query, { type: 'screen', width: `${width}px` }),
}));
```
