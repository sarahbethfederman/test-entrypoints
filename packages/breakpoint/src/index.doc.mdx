## Breakpoints in Typescript/Javascript

Get the name of the current breakpoint by calling `getBreakpoint()` in your Typescript.

If you need to update the breakpoint as the window changes you can use the helper React hook `useBreakpoint(callback: (breakpoint: BreakpointName) => any, debounceInterval: number)`.

## Testing

When testing with `getBreakpoint` or `useBreakpoint` it is advised to mock `@lendi-ui/breakpoint` as `window.matchMedia` is not available on the JSDOM. If you need to test resize functionality, you can instead add something like the following code to your tests to mock the `window.matchMedia` function:

```jsx
import { match } from 'css-mediaquery';

const width: number = 1201

window.matchMedia = jest.fn().mockImplementation((query: string) => ({
  matches: match(query, { type: 'screen', width: `${width}px` }),
}));
```
