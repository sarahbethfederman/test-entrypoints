## legacy breakpoints

For versions ^5.0.0 we will continue to support our legacy breakpoints. However it is recommended to modify your code to use the new breakpoints as soon as possible as they will not be supported in the future.

| Name          | Value          |
| ------------- |:--------------:|
| mobile (xs)   | 0              |
| tablet (sm)   | 576px          |
| desktop (xl)  | 1200px         |

## Breakpoints in Typescript/Javascript

Get the name of the current breakpoint by calling `getBreakpoint()` in your Typescript.

If you need to update the breakpoint as the window changes you can use the helper React hook `useBreakpoint(callback: (breakpoint: BreakpointName) => any, debounceInterval: number)`.

## Testing

When testing with `getBreakpoint` or `useBreakpoint` it is advised to mock `@lendi-ui/breakpoint` as `window.matchMedia` is not available on the JSDOM. If you need to test resize functionality, you can instead add something like the following code to your tests to mock the `window.matchMedia` function:

```jsx
import { match } from 'css-mediaquery';

const width: number = 1201

window.matchMedia = jest.fn().mockImplementation((query: string) => ({
  matches: match(query, { type: 'screen', width: `${width}px` }),
}));
```
