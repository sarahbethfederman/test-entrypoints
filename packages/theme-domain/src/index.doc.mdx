## About
Theme does a couple of things: 
* It injects some basic cross browser resets into the 
head and body of the document (such as resetting margins and padding to 0)
* It sets the font size (as a px unit) at different breakpoints. We can then use r/ems and not 
worry about having to change the font size for every single component.
* Defines the theme color and font-family 

```jsx
  <div> 
    // This sets the base font sizes in px that we use, as 
    // well as the theme (colors, fonts)
    <ThemeDomain>
      ...New stuff using LUI components
    <ThemeDomain/>
  </div>
```
