# Icon

## Adding a new icon

Add the SVG into src/icons. Be thoughtful with naming, as this will determine the name of the component. For example, the file `computer-bank` will create a SVG component called `computerBank` (note that the kebab-case filename will become a camelCase component).

When this package is built, an equivalent react component will be created in src/icons-compiled.
