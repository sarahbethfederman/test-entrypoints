# Setup

> Starting a new application? Our boilerplate, [Liberty](https://bitbucket.org/lendi-dev/liberty/src/master/) has `lendi-ui` set up out-of-the-box.

## Installation

Install `@lendi-ui/theme` and whichever other packages you wish to use e.g. `@lendi-ui/logo`.

```
yarn add @lendi-ui/theme @lendi-ui/logo
```

## Usage

1. Import `@lendi-ui/theme` into your root file:

  ```
  import Theme from '@lendi-ui/theme';
  ```


2. If you're working within `lendi-app` each time you use a LUI component wrap it in a theme. This is 
  because older code might rely on old root styles, so we don't want to override those. 
  ```
    <div>
      <p>Some kind of dialog goes here</p>
      <Theme>
        <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
      </Theme>
    </div>
  ```


  If you're working within a newer repo, wrap your root component with the theme:

  ```
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Theme>
      <App/>
    </Theme>,
    document.getElementById('app')
  );
  ```

3. Import and use one of the other packages:

  ```
  import Logo from '@lendi-ui/logo';

  <Logo variant="dark"/>
  ```
