# Whitelist

All LUI components accept some props in addition to those that are listed within the prop tables on Lendi.design. 
These are aria attributes [extended from this interface](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts#L1449-L1634)
and the following HTML attributes:

    id
    className
    itemProp
    itemScope
    itemType
    itemID
    itemRef
    tabIndex
    title
    role

## Usage

Simply pass the attributes to the component as you would any other prop:
```jsx
<Button id="lui-id" data-test-id="lui-button" size="md" variant="primary">
  Example!
</Button>
```
